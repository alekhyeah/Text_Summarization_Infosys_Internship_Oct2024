# Text_Summarization_Infosys_Internship_Oct2024
This Text Summarization Project aims to develop a tool that efficiently condenses long articles, papers, or documents into concise summaries while preserving the key information and context. Utilizing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, this project focuses on both extractive and abstractive summarization methods.


### Summarization Techniques
  We start off with the understanding of Text Summarization and the ways it can be done in:
  1. Extractive Techniques
  2. Abstractive Techniques

#### Implementation of Extractive Summarization Techniques
  Text Summarization using Extractive Summarization Techniques:
  1. The frequency method
  2. Sumy
  3. Lex Rank
  4. LSA
  Later stage of the notebook consists of the combined code to implement the above algorithms.

  Open file Extractive_Summarization_Techniques.ipynb and run all the cells to demonstrate the working of each algorithm.
